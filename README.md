### How to play:
In the first version of the game, you begin with the green planet. Your enemy is in red.
All the others planets are neutral. The number on the planet is the number of starships that you can generate.
Select one of your planet with left click. You can select multiples planets with a rectangular selection.

You can select the destination of you starships with right click.
 * If the destination is an ally, you will augment the stock of the selected planet.
 * If the destination is an enemy, or a neutral planet, you will decrease its stock.
 	If it's stock decrease to 0, you became the owner of this planet.
 	
 The number of starship on planet owned by players augment each frame, depending of the generation speed of the planet.
 If you are the last player controlling planets, you win the game.
 If it'a an other player who controle the game, you lose :)
